# DON'T RUN THIS!  It is just a coding tutorial.

# This is a practical example of my technique of feeding STDIN to a program
# using the here document feature.  In this example, I am launching Oracle's
# database administration application sqlplus and then providing a series of
# commands.  It logs on, starts the database, and then gets its status before
# exiting.

{
 cat | sqlplus -S /nolog <<- !!!
	conn /as sysdba
	startup
	set heading off
	select status from v$instance;
	exit
	!!!
} 0</dev/null

# Note that I redirect STDIN from the NULL device for the whole block.  Programs
# that request keyboard input from STDIN during operation will leave artifacts
# in the input stream that cause the shell to exhibit erratic behavior after the
# process has run.  Specifically, the shell is left with prompts for input in
# the stream that must be cleared with one or more manual carriage returns.  By
# redirecting STDIN from the NULL device, these are cleared automatically.  I
# have used this technique in many scripts where I am performing basic
# operations that just require a few commands fed to sqlplus or some other
# program.  Instead of calling a separate SQL script that could be altered, I
# just feed my commands in with the here document feature.
#
# The usual way of coding this would be to call sqlplus with the name of a
# script to run like this:

sqlplus -S /nolog @startdb

# The contents of startdb.sql might be as follows:

conn /as sysdba
startup
set heading off
select status from v$instance;
exit

# This separate SQL script must be kept in configuration control as a separate
# configuration item.  It could be altered later without the programmer being
# aware of the consequence on other processes.  For example, a programmer
# might take out the "set heading off" command without realizing that doing so
# could have subtle, unexpected effects on other processes that use the script.
# I have found that it is better to just feed in the commands I want to sqlplus
# within the Korn Shell script without depending on a separate list of commands
# that could be altered.  Of course, I do not do this with complex SQL scripts
# that need to be run, but these separate scripts must be closely tied to the
# KSH scripts that use them.  The configuration control system in use by the
# large organization I work for does not do this, so it is necessary that
# suitable comments be added to the files themselves to explicily name all of
# the dependencies.
