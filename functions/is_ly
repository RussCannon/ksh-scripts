# Function: is_ly
#
# A one-liner that returns a 1 if the parameter is a leap year and a 0 if not.
# First, take a modulo 100.
#  If zero, take a modulo of 400.
#   If zero, it IS a leap year so print 1.
#   Else, it IS NOT a leap year, so print 0.
#  If modulo 100 is non-zero, modulo by 4.
#   If zero, it IS a leap year.
#   Else, it is NOT a leap year.

function is_ly {
 (($1%100==0)) && {(($1%400==0)) && print 1 || print 0;} || {(($1%4==0)) && print 1 || print 0;}
}

# Note:  This was originally done with a slightly longer function that used
# proper if/then/else constructs which would have been more readable, but once
# I had that algorithm down, I instinctively knew that it could be done with a
# one-liner.  The syntax was fiddly, but it worked.
